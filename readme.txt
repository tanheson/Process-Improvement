This is the project for CMV process improvement. This function is to fileter out the valid run result before sending to the centralize folder and generate rollup compilation data.

Considerations
Network Access: Ensure network drives are mapped and accessible (e.g., credentials, VPN).
Permissions: Verify read access to all source_folders and write access to U:/NVL/HX/A0.
Conflicts: Be aware of potential overwrites if multiple sources have the same relative paths.
Disk Space: Ensure U:<< Share drive has sufficient space.
